    <p>I need help creating a Windows Forms Application in Visual Studio Community 2022 using Visual Basic.
      I will describe the purpose of the program and how the user interacts with it.
      The program contains various controls like buttons, checkboxes, labels, and input fields.
      Each control performs specific actions or displays certain results.
      Write the code needed to implement the described functionality in a clear and simple way, focusing only on the required tasks, without error handling."
      Always use the default control naming conventions (e.g., TextBox1, Button1, etc.)
    </p>
